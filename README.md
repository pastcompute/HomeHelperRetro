# Experiments with HomeKit API

## Learnings - part 1

- the API from Swift is actually very simple to use
- it still works on iOS 9.3.5, which is good, as the objective is to try and make use of my otherwise obsolete iPad3
- even though iCloud syncs files and photos with the simulator, it wont sync homekit data
  - to prove this in the end, I had to dual boot my older Intel Mac Mini back to Mojave from a clean USB (so as to avoid screwing things up on Catalina, iOS15 phone or on my M1 Monterey mini) and run up home and rename it from there - this synced with the iPad3 iOS9 but not the simulator
- I have the accessory simulator but haven't manage to do anything useful with it yet
- have the ability to add homes and rooms. Need to get the invite thing working, thats the critical part...
